Greetings! I am Zisheng Zhang (張 孜晟), currently a [Stanford Energy Fellow](https://energypostdoc.stanford.edu/) conducting semi-independent postdoctoral research at the [SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis](https://suncat.stanford.edu/), hosted by Dr. Frank Abild-Pedersen and Prof. Thomas Jaramillo.

As a computational chemist, my research focuses on understanding chemical complexity in emerging catalytic surfaces, electrochemical interfaces, and functional molecules. I develop, maintain, and leverage a computational arsenal of quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, and machine learning approaches.

Prior to Stanford, I did undergraduate research at [Southern University of Science and Technology of China](http://science-en.sustech.edu.cn/research/focusd/id/436.html) with [Prof. Jun Li](http://www.junlilab.org/), completed my MSc & PhD at the [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/) with [Prof. Anastassia N. Alexandrova](http://www.chem.ucla.edu/~ana/), and held a research internship at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) with Dr. Maria Chan.


I am currently looking for Tenure-Track faculty positions in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Material Science, Applied Physics, or other relevant departments. The research plans of the ZZ Lab are summarized in the comic below:

Trivia: I am a alumnus of the late UCLA-CSST program. I did my PhD study remotely from Austin, Texas. I love birding, UrbEx, and ghost towns. I plan to make [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/)-style TOC graphics for all my first- or corresponding-author papers to come, and proposals if possible.

<!-- - Statistical ensemble representation of dynamic clusters and restructuring surfaces in catalytic conditions.
- Development of global optimizers with grand canonical and multi-objective functionality for structure search of crystals, clusters, and surfaces.
- Realistic modeling of electrocatalytic interface to understand the roles of pH, electrode potential, solvation, and electrolyte additives.
- Direct and inverse design of functional molecules and materials for CO$_2$ capture and electroreduction. -->
