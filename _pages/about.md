Greetings! I am Zisheng Zhang (張 孜晟), a [Stanford Energy Postdoctoral Fellow](https://energypostdoc.stanford.edu/) at the SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis. I am working on [computational modeling and design of dynamic boride electrocatalysts](https://energypostdoc.stanford.edu/people/zisheng-zhang), hosted by Dr. Frank Abild-Pederson at SLAC and Prof. Thomas Jaramillo at Department of Chemical Engineering. I got my M.Sc. (2021) and Ph.D. (2024) in Chemistry (specialization: theory and computation) at the [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/), advised by [Prof. Anastaissia N. Alexandrova](http://www.chem.ucla.edu/~ana/). Prior to joining UCLA, I received my B.Sc. in Chemistry from the [South University of Science and Technology of China](http://science-en.sustech.edu.cn/research/focusd/id/436.html) in 2019, advised by [Prof. Jun Li](http://www.junlilab.org/).

I am passionate about a wide range of topics in theoretical and computational chemistry, including both method development and applications. My current research focuses on multi-scale realistic modeling of dynamic surface and interfaces in heterogeneous thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis under reaction conditions. I am also interested in inverse design of functional molecules/materials, chemical bonding analysis, global optimization algorithms, and data-driven methods. I have been and will continue developing an arsenal of advanced computational methods combining theoretical chemistry (QM and Stat Mech) and  AI/ML to address the complexities in chemical systems. Please take a look at the "projects" page to learn more about my research and publications!

I am currently looking for Tenure-Track faculty positions in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Material Science, Applied Physics, or other relevant departments. The research plans of the ZZ Lab are summarized in the comic below:

Trivia: I am a alumnus of the late UCLA-CSST program. I did a research internship at Center for Nanoscale Materials, Argonne National Lab in 2022. I was a rhythmic guitarist on a local band based in Austin, Texas. I love UrbEx and ghost towns. I plan to make [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/)-style TOC graphics for all my first- or corresponding-author papers to come, and proposals if possible.

<!-- - Statistical ensemble representation of dynamic clusters and restructuring surfaces in catalytic conditions.
- Development of global optimizers with grand canonical and multi-objective functionality for structure search of crystals, clusters, and surfaces.
- Realistic modeling of electrocatalytic interface to understand the roles of pH, electrode potential, solvation, and electrolyte additives.
- Direct and inverse design of functional molecules and materials for CO$_2$ capture and electroreduction. -->
